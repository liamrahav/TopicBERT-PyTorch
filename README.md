# TopicBERT-PyTorch
PyTorch implementation of Chaudhary et. al. 2020's TopicBERT

### Getting Started:

Install [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) if you have not already done so. Then run

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create a Python environment that strictly adheres to the versioning indicated in the [project proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oEE8oxiM95Tf99SxUhPXgZj3GkotFtlM/view). It is intended to closely mirror Google Colab.
